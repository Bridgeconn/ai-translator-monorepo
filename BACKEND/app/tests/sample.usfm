\mt1 The First Book of Moses Called Genesis
\c 1
\v 1 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
\v 2 Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.
\c 2
\v 1 Thus the heavens and the earth were completed in all their vast array.
\v 2 By the seventh day God had finished the work he had been doing; so on the seventh day he rested from all his work.
